# ArcGIS-Tools
This repository is a collection of ArcGIS tools I created for the Colorado Geological Survey

Lidar clipping - A clipping model I created that clips a DEM, and iteratively creates slope, hillshade, aspect, contour etc. from the original DEM

Hazard Derivative Tools (IN PROGRESS) - I'm working on ArcGIS tools that would automatically determine the geologic hazards in an area of interest in the state of Colorado, given input geology and a DEM from Colorado Geological Survey data

Landslide Logic (IN PROGRESS) - This logic will be incorporated into the 'Landslide' hazard tool. It creates polygons from rasters that meet a certain slope angle criteria
